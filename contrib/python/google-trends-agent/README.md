# Google Trends Agent

## Overview

The Google Trends Agent is an AI agent designed to surface the newest Google Trends in real-time. It can identify emerging topics, analyze their velocity, and provide insights into what is currently capturing the world's attention. This is useful for content creators, marketers, and analysts who need to stay ahead of the curve. For example, a marketer could use this agent as part of their workflow to design a marketing campaign based on a trend in a specific region or city that relates to the product or service they promote.

## Disclaimer

This agent has several important limitations to be aware of:

- **Dataset Constraints**: The agent can only access data that exists in the [public Google Trends BigQuery dataset](https://support.google.com/trends/answer/12764470?hl=en), which contains only the top trending terms by region and time period.
- **No Open-ended Searches**: You cannot ask for trends on specific topics (e.g., "trending terms about AI agents") if they aren't already ranked as top terms in the dataset.
- **Regional Limitations**: Only regions included in the BigQuery dataset are available.

## Agent Details

This agent is a sequential agent composed of two sub-agents that work together to fetch and analyze Google Trends data. The first sub-agent, `TrendsQueryGeneratorAgent`, generates a BigQuery SQL query from the user's request. The second sub-agent, `TrendsQueryExecutorAgent`, executes this query to retrieve the trends data and present it to the user. This modular design can be extended with more complex, multi-agent workflows.

| Feature              | Description           |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Interaction Type** | Conversational        |
| **Complexity**       | Medium                |
| **Agent Type**       | Sequential Agent      |
| **Components**       | Tools: BigQuery       |
| **Vertical**         | Marketing & Analytics |

- **Core Logic:** The agent's main logic is defined in `app/agent.py`.
- **Tools:** It utilizes tools to query the public [Google Trends dataset on BigQuery](https://support.google.com/trends/answer/12764470?hl=en) to fetch trending data. You can explore querying the [Google Trends dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-datasets/google-search-trends) in Google Cloud Console.
- **Dependencies:** Key dependencies include `google-cloud-aiplatform` for the ADK and agent engine deployment, `google-cloud-bigquery` and `pandas` for data handling.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Prerequisites**

    - Python 3.11+
    - Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
    - A Google Cloud Platform project.
    - The [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

2.  **Installation**

    ```bash
    # Navigate to the agent's directory
    cd adk-recipes/contrib/python/google-trends-agent
    # Install the package and dependencies.
    uv sync --dev
    ```

3.  **Configuration**

    - Set up your Google Cloud credentials. You can set these in your shell or create a `.env` file in the agent's root directory (`google-trends-agent/`).

      ```bash
      # Authenticate your gcloud account
      gcloud auth application-default login
      gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project <your-project-id>

      # Create and populate .env file
      cp .env.example .env
      ```

    - Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration:

      ```env
      GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="<your-project-id>"
      GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="<your-project-location>"
      GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET="<your-storage-bucket>" # Required for deployment
      ```

    - Before deploying, grant the deployed agent permission to run BigQuery
      jobs; see [Permissions](#permissions). Running locally uses your own
      gcloud credentials instead.

## Running the Agent Locally

You can run the agent locally using the `adk` command in your terminal.

1.  **To run the agent from the CLI:**

    From the recipe root (`contrib/python/google-trends-agent`), run:

    ```bash
    adk run app
    ```

2.  **To run the agent from the ADK web UI:**

    Also from the recipe root:

    ```bash
    adk web
    ```
    Then select `app` from the dropdown menu.

## Permissions

A deployed agent runs as a platform identity, not as you. That identity needs
`roles/bigquery.user` on your project to run query jobs. The Google Trends
dataset is public, so no dataset-level role is needed.

| Where it runs | Runtime identity |
|---|---|
| Agent Runtime / Agent Engine (`deployment/deploy.py`, `agents-cli deploy -d agent_runtime`, Agent Garden) | `service-<PROJECT_NUMBER>@gcp-sa-aiplatform-re.iam.gserviceaccount.com` |
| Cloud Run (`agents-cli deploy`) | the service's runtime service account (default: the Compute Engine default service account) |

For Agent Runtime:

```bash
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
export PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe $PROJECT_ID --format='value(projectNumber)')

# Make sure the Agent Runtime service agent exists (no-op if it already does).
gcloud beta services identity create --service=aiplatform.googleapis.com --project=$PROJECT_ID

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
    --member="serviceAccount:service-${PROJECT_NUMBER}@gcp-sa-aiplatform-re.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/bigquery.user"
```

For Cloud Run, grant the same role (plus `roles/aiplatform.user`) to the
service's runtime service account.

If the grant is missing, the agent replies *"BigQuery refused the query: this
agent's runtime identity is not allowed to run BigQuery jobs"*. Run the grant
above and ask again; IAM changes can take a minute to apply.

## Deploying the Agent Remotely

### To Agent Engine

The agent can also be deployed to [Vertex AI Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview).

1.  **Ensure Prerequisites:** Make sure your `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`, and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET` environment variables are set correctly in your `.env` file.

2.  **Run the deployment script:**
    ```bash
    uv sync --group deployment
    uv run python deployment/deploy.py
    ```
    When the deployment finishes, it will output the resource ID of the remote agent deployment and update your `.env` file with the `AGENT_ENGINE_ID`. For example:
    ```
    Created remote agent: projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/locations/<PROJECT_LOCATION>/reasoningEngines/<AGENT_ENGINE_ID>
    ```
3.  **Test the remote agent:**
    Once deployed, you can interact with the remote agent by running:
    ```bash
    python deployment/test_deployment.py
    ```
    You can type `quit` at any point to exit.

### As a Container (Cloud Run)

The recipe ships a `Dockerfile` that serves the agent with FastAPI on port
8080 (`app/fast_api_app.py`), exposing the ADK API and an A2A endpoint.
Model names default to the values in `.env.example`, which is copied into the
image; override any of them with environment variables.

1.  **Build and run locally** (uses your Application Default Credentials):
    ```bash
    docker build -t google-trends-agent .
    docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
        -e GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=<your-project-id> \
        -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/tmp/adc.json \
        -v ~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json:/tmp/adc.json:ro \
        google-trends-agent
    curl localhost:8080/list-apps
    ```

2.  **Deploy to Cloud Run** with `agents-cli` (the `google-agents-cli`
    package), which reads
    `agents-cli-manifest.yaml` (target `cloud_run`, region `us-central1`) and
    runs `gcloud run deploy --source .` for you. From the recipe root:
    ```bash
    agents-cli deploy --project <your-project-id> --dry-run  # preview
    agents-cli deploy --project <your-project-id>
    ```
    The service is private (`--no-allow-unauthenticated`). Grant its runtime
    service account the roles in [Permissions](#permissions).

    > **Note:** `agents-cli deploy` forwards every variable in your local
    > `.env` to the service. Check the `--dry-run` output, or deploy from a
    > clean checkout, if your `.env` points at a different project.

3.  **Talk to the deployed agent:**
    ```bash
    agents-cli run --url <service-url> --mode a2a "What's trending in Canada this week?"
    ```
    or call the ADK API directly with
    `-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)"`.

### Example Interaction

**User:** List the top 10 terms in Canada during the past 3 weeks

**[TrendsQueryGeneratorAgent]:**

```sql
SELECT
  term,
  rank,
  week
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_trends.international_top_terms`
WHERE
  refresh_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
  AND refresh_date = (
    SELECT MAX(refresh_date)
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_trends.international_top_terms`
    WHERE refresh_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
  )
  AND country_name = 'Canada'
  AND week IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT
      week

## Security Considerations

This agent **executes SQL generated by a language model**. Treat that as the
core trust boundary:

- **Run it as a least-privilege identity.** The query runs with whatever
  credentials the process holds, so it can read any table that identity can
  read — not just the Google Trends dataset. Grant a service account
  `roles/bigquery.jobUser` on your billing project and read access scoped to
  `bigquery-public-data.google_trends`, rather than reusing a broad personal
  or owner credential.
- **A prompt can influence the query.** A user who can reach the agent can
  steer the generated SQL. The least-privilege identity above is the real
  containment; the prompt rules are guidance to the model, not a security
  control.
- **Cost is bounded, not free.** `app/tools.py` sets
  `maximum_bytes_billed` (8 GiB), which makes BigQuery reject an over-large
  job before it runs, plus a 60-second wait timeout. The value is measured:
  the widest legitimate query scans 3.91 GB, while a query that omits the
  `refresh_date` range predicate scans 10.19 GB — so the limit blocks the
  latter and allows the former. Tune it if you widen the lookback window.
- **Errors are not echoed verbatim.** Backend failures are logged and replaced
  with a generic message, so raw errors naming projects, datasets or tables
  are not returned to the caller.

## Customization

You can customize this agent to fit your specific needs:

- **Change Data Source:** Modify the agent's tools to pull trend data from different sources, such as social media APIs or other analytics platforms.
- **Enhance Analysis:** Add new tools to perform more in-depth analysis on the trends, deeper research (e.g. using Google Search as an additional tool) such as sentiment analysis or forecasting.
- **Add Notifications:** Integrate tools that send alerts via email or Slack when a new trend matching specific criteria is detected.
